This is a simple script called from a systemd service which:

1. parses /proc/cmdline for nid= and xname= parameters
2. creates the files /etc/cray/nid and /etc/cray/xname as appropriate

It doesn't really belong as a boot service. It should be replaced by salt or whatever Cray chooses for config management.
